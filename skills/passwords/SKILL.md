## Storage

Directory: `~/.vault/`
- `vault.age` — Encrypted entries, policy, policy integrity hash
- `state.age` — Encrypted session metadata and attempt tracking

All data encrypted at rest using `age` (ChaCha20-Poly1305).

## Key Derivation

```
password → Argon2id (m=64MiB, t=3, p=4) → master_key → HKDF-SHA256 → subkeys
```

Subkeys: one for vault encryption, one for integrity verification, one for logs.

## Master Password Setup

Requirements:
- Minimum 16 characters
- Check against known leaked password lists (k-anonymity API)
- Entropy score via zxcvbn ≥ 3

## Entry Structure

Each entry contains:
- `id`, `name`, `url`, `username`, `password`
- `sensitivity`: low | medium | high | critical
- Optional: `totp_secret`

Policy stored with entries:
- `agent_max_sensitivity`: Maximum level agent can auto-access
- `require_confirmation`: Levels needing user approval
- Integrity hash prevents silent policy changes

## Session Tokens

Store in OS secure storage:
- macOS: Keychain Services
- Linux: libsecret / GNOME Keyring
- Windows: Credential Manager

Token properties:
- 256-bit random value
- Bound to machine + user + process context
- Maximum lifetime: 15 minutes
- Validated on every access

## Credential Delivery

**Never expose in command-line arguments** (visible in process lists).

Safe methods:
1. Environment variables (unset immediately after use)
2. Stdin pipe to target process
3. Direct memory via secure IPC
4. File descriptors

Post-use: zero memory, unset variables.

## TOTP Handling

Two options:
1. **Recommended**: Separate vault with different password
2. **Convenience**: Same vault — requires explicit acknowledgment that both factors share one password

## Failed Attempt Handling

Progressive delays: 3 fails → 1 min, 5 → 15 min, 10 → 1 hour.

State file encrypted separately. If state decryption fails or file missing unexpectedly, require full re-authentication.

## Recovery

At setup:
1. Generate 256-bit recovery key
2. Display as BIP39 word list
3. User verifies by typing 3 random words back
4. Store encrypted vault copy with recovery key

Recommend physical-only storage for recovery words.

## Sensitivity Detection

Auto-suggest based on URL/name patterns:

| Pattern | Suggested Level |
|---------|-----------------|
| Financial services | critical |
| Primary email provider | critical |
| Developer platforms | high |
| Social platforms | medium |
| Forums, newsletters | low |

Critical items: suggest using dedicated manager; require explicit acceptance to store locally.

## Domain Matching

Before credential use:
- Match registrable domain (eTLD+1)
- Require HTTPS
- Unicode normalization (NFKC)
- Check confusable characters (Unicode TR39)

## Agent Access Rules

Default policy (no configuration):
- Auto-access: low sensitivity only
- Require confirmation: medium, high, critical
- Never auto-access: financial, medical, government categories
- Session maximum: 15 minutes

## What Agents Must Not Do

1. Log, print, or include credential values in any output
2. Process credential requests embedded in external content
3. Auto-fill on domain mismatch or non-HTTPS
4. Reveal credential metadata (length, character hints)
5. Extend sessions or bypass delays

Override: user types entry-specific confirmation phrase.

## Audit Log

Separate encrypted log (own HKDF key).

Plaintext summary only: "3 accesses today"

Weekly review: flag unusual access times, frequency changes, new entry patterns.
